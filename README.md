## Introduction
Our team is tackling the challenge of optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) resource allocation through statistical analysis. By improving HPC utilization, we aim to help researchers run their experiments faster and more efficiently, thereby accelerating scientific discoveries.

## Dataset
The dataset includes three types of data:
- **Time series:** e.g., host load, job load
- **Events:** e.g., job status changes
- **Configurations:** job submission info, cluster configuration

_more details of the dataset will be available before the challenge starts._

## Mission
Our mission is to leverage our collective expertise to improve the understanding of HPC statistics and find measures to enhance HPC utilization.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/stjude-biohackathon/KIDS24-team3.git
    ```
